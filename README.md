# river

_an experiment by <a href="https://davis7.sh" target="_blank">ben davis</a> that went WAY too far..._

> [!WARNING]
> As I said, this is alpha software that's gonna change. A new branch has been made and is in progress (ben/river-alpha-v2). It's a very heavy refactor of all the api's that will result in the ability to do resumable streams, have a unified api for all the agents, and support more frameworks then sveltekit...

## it's TRPC, but for agents/streams...

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { myRiverClient } from '$lib/river/client';

	// ALL of this is type safe, feels just like TRPC
	const { start, stop } = myRiverClient.basicExample({
		onStart: () => {
			console.log('starting basic example');
		},
		onChunk: (chunk) => {
			// full type safety on the chunks
		},
		onCancel: () => {
			console.warn('you cancelled the basic example');
		},
		onError: (error) => {
			console.error('error in basic example', error);
		},
		onComplete: ({ totalChunks, duration }) => {
			console.log(`basic example completed in ${duration}ms with ${totalChunks} chunks`);
		}
	});
</script>
```

```bash
bun i @davis7dotsh/river-alpha
```

**this is alpha software, use it at your own risk. api's will change, bugs will be fixed, features will be added, etc...**

## what you get

- full type safety
- rpc-like function calling
- trpc mutation like interface for consuming the streams
- ai sdk streaming support **with full stack type safety**
- custom stream support **with zod validation on chunks**

this project does actually work right now, but it is very early in development and NOT recommended for production use. **it is in alpha, the apis will change a lot...**

## local package dev setup

1. get an openrouter api key
2. add it to your `.env.local` file (see `.env.example`)
3. `bun i`
4. `bun dev`

## getting started using the package

if you want to try this out, it's now available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@davis7dotsh/river-alpha)!

i've built out two examples, one using the ai-sdk and one using a custom stream.

they're both are fully type safe, are pleasant to work in, and work great: <a href="https://github.com/bmdavis419/river-examples" target="_blank">check them out</a>

### here's a quick getting started guide for custom streams

0. create a new sveltekit project (if you don't have one already)

```bash
bunx sv create river-demo
```

1. install dependencies

```bash
bun i @davis7dotsh/river-alpha zod
```

2. setup your first agent (this looks slightly different for the <a href="https://github.com/bmdavis419/river-examples/blob/main/basic-aisdk-example/src/lib/river/agents.ts" target="_blank">ai-sdk agents</a>)

```ts
// src/lib/river/agents.ts
import { RIVER_SERVER } from '@davis7dotsh/river-alpha';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const basicExampleAgent = RIVER_SERVER.createCustomAgent({
	inputSchema: z.object({
		message: z.string()
	}),
	streamChunkSchema: z.object({
		letter: z.string(),
		isVowel: z.boolean()
	}),
	// a stream will automatically be created for you when you call this agent
	// first param is the input, second param is a function to append chunks to the stream
	// the stream will close when the agent returns
	agent: async ({ message }, appendChunk) => {
		const letters = message.split('');
		const onlyLetters = letters.filter((letter) => /^[a-zA-Z]$/.test(letter));
		for (let i = 0; i < onlyLetters.length; i++) {
			const letter = onlyLetters[i];
			const isVowel = /^[aeiou]$/i.test(letter);
			appendChunk({ letter, isVowel });
			await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 20));
		}
	}
});
```

3. setup your router

```ts
// src/lib/river/router.ts
import { RIVER_SERVER } from '@davis7dotsh/river-alpha';
import { basicExampleAgent } from './agents';

export const myRiverRouter = RIVER_SERVER.createAgentRouter({
	// I recommend having the key not be the name of the agent, this will make the go to definition experience much better
	basicExample: basicExampleAgent
});

// this is to get type inference on the client
export type MyRiverRouter = typeof myRiverRouter;
```

4. setup the endpoint

```ts
// src/routes/api/river/+server.ts
import { myRiverRouter } from '$lib/river/router';
import { RIVER_SERVER } from '@davis7dotsh/river-alpha';

// this is all it takes, nothing else needed
// NOTE: this is sveltekit specific, more frameworks coming eventually...
export const { POST } = RIVER_SERVER.createServerEndpointHandler(myRiverRouter);
```

5. setup the client

```ts
// src/lib/river/client.ts
import { RIVER_CLIENT } from '@davis7dotsh/river-alpha';
import type { MyRiverRouter } from './router';

// similar to a trpc client, this is how we call the agents from the client
export const myRiverClient = RIVER_CLIENT.createClientCaller<MyRiverRouter>('/api/river');
```

6. use your agent on the client with a client side caller

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/+page.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
	import { myRiverClient } from '$lib/river/client';

	// this works just like mutations in trpc, it will not actually run until you call start
	// the callbacks are optional, and will fire when they are defined and the agent starts
	const basicExampleCaller = myRiverClient.basicExample({
		onStart: () => {
			// fires when the agent starts
			console.log('Starting basic example');
		},
		onChunk: ({ letter, isVowel }) => {
			// fires when a chunk is received
			// will always just have one chunk and is fully type safe
			console.log(`${letter} is ${isVowel ? 'a vowel' : 'a consonant'}`);
		},
		onCancel: () => {
			// fires when the agent is cancelled/stopped
			console.log('You cancelled the basic example');
		},
		onError: (error) => {
			// fires when the agent errors
			console.error('Error in basic example', error);
		},
		onComplete: ({ totalChunks, duration }) => {
			// fires when the agent completes
			// this will ALWAYS fire last, even if the agent was cancelled or errored
			console.log(`Basic example completed in ${duration}ms with ${totalChunks} chunks`);
		}
	});

	const handleStart = async () => {
		// actually starts the agent
		await basicExampleCaller.start({
			message: 'This is in fact a message'
		});
	};

	const handleCancel = () => {
		// stops the agent (uses an abort controller under the hood)
		basicExampleCaller.stop();
	};
</script>

<!-- some UI to to consume and start the stream -->
```

## project info

### why make this?

- streams went from something you touch every once and a while, to something we're using all the time
- i want typesafety
- mutations are awesome in tanstack query, i want them for streams
- rpc >>>>>>
- streams are a pain to consume out of the box (readers and encoders and raw fetch and type casting and more annoying shit)

### FEATURES TODO/IN PROGRESS

- cleanup package deps, currently too many are bundled in
- more robust error handling on both client and server. want to do something similar to trpc's `TRPCError`
- stream resumability support. need to figure out a good way to dump the stream to a persistent store so we can easily resume later **will require api changes**
- "waitUntil" support. this pretty much goes hand and hand with stream resumability

## docs for: `0.0.5`

_see the examples for more detailed usage, these api's will change..._

### core primitives

1. **agents**: these come in two flavors, `AiSdkAgent` and `CustomAgent`. The ai-sdk agent is for when you want to use the `streamText` function from the `ai` package. The custom agent is for when you want to do custom stuff and just need a type safe stream (validated with zod)
2. **agent router**: the is the thing you create on the server which will allow you to call agents. VERY similar to a TRPC router.
3. **agent client**: this is the client side primitive for actually calling agents. It's fully type safe (grabs types from the router) and feels like the trpc client.
4. **endpoint handler**: this is something you will basically never touch. it's just a function that returns a POST handler for actually processing your requests

### helper types

these are a few helper types I made that really help with getting good type safety in your clients. the names are a bit verbose, but at least they're descriptive...

```ts
// gets the "tool set" type (a record of tool names to their tool types) for an ai-sdk agent
type AiSdkAgentToolSet = RiverClientCallerAiSdkToolSetType<typeof riverClient.exampleAiSdkAgent>;

// gets the input type for a tool call for an ai-sdk agent. pass in the tool set type and the tool name
type ImposterToolCallInputType = RiverClientCallerToolCallInputType<
	AiSdkAgentToolSet,
	'imposterCheck'
>;

// gets the output type for a tool call for an ai-sdk agent. pass in the tool set type and the tool name
type ImposterToolCallOutputType = RiverClientCallerToolCallOutputType<
	AiSdkAgentToolSet,
	'imposterCheck'
>;

// gets the chunk type for an agent (the thing passed to the onChunk callback)
type AiSdkAgentChunk = RiverClientCallerChunkType<typeof riverClient.exampleAiSdkAgent>;

// gets the input type for an agent (the thing passed to the start function)
type AiSdkAgentInputType = RiverClientCallerInputType<typeof riverClient.exampleAiSdkAgent>;
```
